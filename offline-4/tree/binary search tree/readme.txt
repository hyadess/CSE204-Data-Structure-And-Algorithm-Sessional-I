I have implemented basic BST ADT with functions insert, delete, find and traversals. Here I didn't use any explicit "key"
to compare two nodes. my elements which extends comparable class, is used for the comparisons...

here bstNode class is used as the nodes of my BST with reference of its left and right child.....

I have read input.txt file as inputs from user.
