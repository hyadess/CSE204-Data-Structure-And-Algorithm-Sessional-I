Assalamu Alaikum...

My project is all about implementing a list interface through both array and linked_list.

in List_interface package, I have created a LIst interface having those required functions. This interface has been implemented by List_array and Linked_list..

To create linked list, I needed nodes that can have data and address of the next node.I created a node class inside List_implementation package.So, node class can 
only be accessed by the Linked_list class.

I created a TNL_implementation class which can simulate the TNL system. It takes two LIst( both Linked_list and List_array) and print the encoded TNL. further functions
can be added later.

to check the functionality of those implementations, I created two main functions: List_checking and TNL_checking. those class takes the inputs and check the List and TNL
implementations respectively...both classes works for both array and List instantiation.
